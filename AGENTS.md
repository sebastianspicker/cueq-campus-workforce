## 2. Small, Reviewable Change Policy

All changes to this repo MUST follow these rules:

1. **One concern per PR.** Do not mix feature work with refactoring, doc updates with code changes, or schema changes with test changes.
2. **Maximum 400 lines changed per PR** (excluding auto-generated files). If a change is larger, split it.
3. **Every PR must include:**
   - A clear title following [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format: `type(scope): description`
   - A description of _what_ changed and _why_
   - Link to the relevant exec-plan or issue
4. **Branch naming:** `type/short-description` (e.g., `feat/time-engine-rules`, `docs/glossary-update`, `fix/leave-calculation`)
5. **No force-pushes to `main`.** All changes go through PR review.

### Conventional Commit Types

| Type       | When to Use                                |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------ |

| `fix`      | Bug fix                                    |
| `docs`     | Documentation only                         |
| `schema`   | Schema or type definition changes          |
| `test`     | Adding or updating tests                   |
| `ci`       | CI/CD pipeline changes                     |
| `refactor` | Code restructuring without behavior change |
| `chore`    | Tooling, dependencies, config              |

## 4. Definition of Done

A change is "done" when ALL of the following are true:

### For Code Changes

- [ ] `make check` passes locally
- [ ] CI pipeline is green
- [ ] New/changed behavior has corresponding tests
- [ ] Schema changes have been regenerated (`make generate`)
- [ ] Relevant documentation updated (design docs, glossary, ADRs)
- [ ] PR has been reviewed by at least one human or designated reviewer

### For Documentation Changes

- [ ] All cross-links are valid (no broken references)
- [ ] New docs are listed in the relevant `index.md`
- [ ] Terminology matches [`docs/design-docs/core-beliefs.md`](docs/design-docs/core-beliefs.md) and the domain glossary
- [ ] No secrets, credentials, or PII in any document

### For Schema Changes

- [ ] Schema validates with `make schemas`
- [ ] Types regenerated with `make generate`
- [ ] Fixtures updated to match new schema (if applicable)
- [ ] Affected tests still pass

---

## 5. Security & Privacy Constraints

These constraints are **non-negotiable** and apply to every contribution:

### Hard Rules

1. **No secrets in the repo.** No API keys, passwords, tokens, or certificates. Use `.env.example` for templates.
2. **No telemetry.** Do not add any analytics, tracking, or phone-home functionality.
3. **No PII in fixtures or test data.** Use synthetic data only. Names must be obviously fictional.
4. **No external service calls in tests.** All tests must work offline with mocks or local containers.
5. **Audit trail immutability.** Any code touching the audit log must enforce append-only semantics. Deletions and mutations of audit entries are forbidden.

### GDPR / University Environment

- Data minimization: only collect and store what is required for the documented purpose.
- Role-based access: every endpoint and view must enforce role checks.
- Absence reasons are never visible to unauthorized roles (team members see "absent", not "sick").
- Reports must be configurable to avoid individual performance/behavior monitoring (works council / Personalrat compliance).
- Retention/deletion policies must be configurable per data category.

### Privacy-by-Design Checkpoints

When adding new features, confirm:

- [ ] What personal data is collected?
- [ ] Who can access it (which roles)?
- [ ] When is it deleted (retention period)?
- [ ] Is it included in any export? If so, is it necessary?
- [ ] Can reporting be aggregated to avoid individual identification?
