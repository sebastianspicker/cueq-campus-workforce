## Current Phase: Phase 3 — Integrations + Operations

**Goal**: Deliver pilot-ready integrations and operations hardening (terminal gateway ops, HR import, payroll export, backup/restore verification).

**Status**: ✅ Completed on branch (pending merge/default-branch confirmation)

### Definition of Done (Phase 0)

- [x] `make check` passes on a fresh clone (validated by CI smoke job)
- [ ] CI runs green on the default branch (external confirmation required)
- [x] All schemas pass validation
- [x] ADR-001 is written and merged
- [x] A new contributor can run `make setup && make check` successfully (validated by CI smoke job)

Default-branch confirmation should include workflow run URL and commit SHA when reconciled after merge.

## Phase 1 — Domain Core

### Deliverables

- [x] `packages/core/src/core/time-engine/`: plausibility checks, balance calculation, rule-violation mapping
- [x] `packages/core/src/core/absence/`: pro-rata targets and leave quota/carry-over/forfeiture helpers
- [x] `packages/core/src/core/workflow/`: approval state machine, escalation trigger, delegation chain resolution
- [x] `packages/core/src/core/roster/`: shift compliance, min-staffing, plan-vs-actual
- [x] `packages/core/src/core/closing/`: checklist generation and cut-off lock transitions
- [x] `packages/core/src/core/audit/`: immutable audit entry builder (append-only API surface)
- [x] Core domain schemas under `schemas/domain/core-*.schema.json`
- [x] Type generation wired into `make generate` (`scripts/generate-core-schema-types.mjs`)
- [x] Dual fixture tracks: synthetic (`fixtures/reference-calculations/`) + anonymized-derived (`fixtures/reference-calculations-real/`)
- [x] NRW holiday dataset (`fixtures/calendars/nrw-holidays-2026.json`) for deterministic rule tests
- [x] Coverage gate configured for `packages/core/src/core/**` (>=90% lines/statements/functions)

### Definition of Done (Phase 1)

- [x] 4 reference calculations pass (flextime, shift/Pforte, part-time change, on-call/IT)
- [x] Rule violations correctly detected per PRD
- [x] Audit entries immutable by type-system design
- [x] Domain glossary complete in `docs/design-docs/core-beliefs.md`
