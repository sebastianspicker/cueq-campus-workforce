# Core Beliefs — cueq Design Principles

---

## 1. Correctness Over Convenience

The system deals with legally relevant data (working hours, leave quotas, payroll exports). **Incorrect calculations are worse than slow calculations.** Every arithmetic operation on time, leave, or surcharges must be:

- Backed by a reference calculation fixture
- Tested against the fixture in CI
- Versioned alongside the rule that governs it

## 2. Auditability Is Not Optional

A German university under TV-L must demonstrate compliance to the Personalrat (works council), data protection officers, and external auditors. Therefore:

- Every state change produces an **immutable audit entry** (who, what, when, why)
- Audit entries are **append-only** — no update, no delete, no truncate
- Workflow decisions (approval, rejection, delegation) are part of the audit trail
- Rule changes are versioned (which rule set was active when a calculation was performed?)

## 3. Privacy by Default

Data minimization is a legal requirement (GDPR / DSGVO) and an institutional expectation:

- **Colleagues see "absent", not "sick".** Absence reasons are role-gated.
- **Reports must not enable individual performance monitoring.** Aggregation and role checks are mandatory.
- **Retention is configurable.** Data categories have distinct deletion schedules.
- **No telemetry.** The system does not phone home, does not collect usage analytics, does not embed third-party trackers.

## 4. Configuration Over Hard-Coding

The university has diverse employee groups (TV-L admin, shifts, student assistants, lecturers, potentially civil servants) and four distinct shift domains (Pforte, IT, Hausdienst, Veranstaltungstechnik). Rules differ across groups:

- Work-time models, pause rules, surcharge rules, and leave quotas are data, not code
- Rule sets are assigned per employee group / organizational unit
- Changes to rules take effect from a configurable date (not retroactively by default)

## 5. Schema-Driven Contracts

Every interface boundary is defined by a machine-readable schema:

- **Domain entities** → JSON Schema
- **API endpoints** → OpenAPI 3.1
- **Events** → JSON Schema event envelopes
- **Exports** → Schema-defined column/field layouts

Types are generated from schemas, not hand-written. If the schema and the code disagree, the schema wins.

## 6. Offline Resilience

Honeywell terminals can go offline. The system must:

- Buffer bookings locally at the terminal or gateway
- Synchronize without data loss when connectivity returns
- Flag and resolve conflicts (duplicate bookings, out-of-order timestamps)
- Support a manual fallback process (emergency bookings with approval)

## 7. Small, Verifiable Changes

Complexity kills correctness. Every change to cueq must be:

- **Small** — max 400 lines per PR (excl. generated files)
- **Reviewable** — one concern per PR, conventional commit format
- **Testable** — new behavior includes new tests
- **Documented** — design decisions recorded as ADRs
