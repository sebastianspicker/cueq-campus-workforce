# Tech Debt Tracker

> Track known technical debt items. Review this list at the start of each phase. Items should be resolved before they compound.

---

## How to Use

1. Add new items as they're discovered during development or review.
2. Prioritize by **impact × effort** — high-impact / low-effort items first.
3. Link to the PR that resolves the item when complete.
4. Move resolved items to the "Resolved" section with a date.
