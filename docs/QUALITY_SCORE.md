# QUALITY_SCORE.md — Quality Metrics & Targets

> This document defines measurable quality targets for cueq. Each metric should be automatable and reportable in CI.

## 2. Test Suite Performance

| Suite                                       | Max Duration | Notes                                |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------ |

## 3. Acceptance Test Health

| #     | Test                             | Phase Target |
| ----- | -------------------------------- | ------------ |
| AT-01 | Terminal offline → sync          | Phase 3      |
| AT-02 | Correction → delegation chain    | Phase 3      |
| AT-03 | Roster plan-vs-actual            | Phase 3      |
| AT-04 | Leave part-time carry-over       | Phase 3      |
| AT-05 | On-call + Sunday deployment      | Phase 3      |
| AT-06 | Closing + export + HR correction | Phase 3      |
| AT-07 | Role-based visibility            | Phase 3      |
| AT-08 | Backup / restore                 | Phase 3      |

**Quality gate**: No phase is complete until its designated acceptance tests pass.

## 4. Schema & Type Health

| Metric                                       | Target | Check                                     |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| All JSON Schemas compile                     | ✅     | `make schemas`                            |
| Generated types match schemas                | ✅     | `make generate` + diff check              |
| No hand-written types that duplicate schemas | ✅     | ESLint `cueq/no-manual-schema-types` rule |
| OpenAPI spec matches implementation          | ✅     | Contract tests                            |

## 5. Code Quality

| Metric                             | Target     | Tool                  |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------- | --------------------- |

| Cyclomatic complexity per function | ≤15        | Aspirational (review) |
| Maximum file length                | ≤400 lines | PR policy target      |

## 6. Documentation Quality

| Metric                              | Target | Check                                              |
| ----------------------------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Broken internal links               | 0      | Markdown link checker in CI                        |
| New entity without glossary entry   | 0      | Code review checklist                              |
| ADR for every non-trivial decision  | ✅     | Code review checklist                              |
| Product spec for every feature area | ✅     | [`product-specs/index.md`](product-specs/index.md) |

`Broken internal links` is currently enforced via `pnpm docs:links` in `make check` and CI.

## 7. Accessibility (UI)

| Metric                       | Target | Tool                          | Phase   |
| ---------------------------- | ------ | ----------------------------- | ------- |
| axe-core critical violations | 0      | Playwright + axe-core CI gate | Phase 2 |
| axe-core serious violations  | 0      | Playwright + axe-core CI gate | Phase 3 |
| WCAG 2.1 AA conformance      | Full   | Manual audit                  | Phase 3 |

## 8. Operational Quality

| Metric                | Target                      | Phase    |
| --------------------- | --------------------------- | -------- |
| CI pipeline pass rate | >95% (excludes flaky infra) | Phase 0+ |
| Build-to-deploy time  | <10 minutes                 | Phase 3  |
| Backup/restore test   | Passes weekly in CI         | Phase 3  |
| Terminal health check | Heartbeat monitored         | Phase 3  |

---

## 9. Tracking

Quality metrics should be:

1. **Automated** — reported by CI, not manually tracked
2. **Visible** — dashboard or CI badge on README
3. **Trended** — track over time to detect regression

CI metrics are surfaced through GitHub Actions job summaries and required status checks.

Enforced repository gates (current):

- `make check` (lint, format check, typecheck, docs link check, schema checks, tests, policy golden, openapi check)
- `make test-all` (unit, integration, acceptance, compliance, backup/restore)
- `cueq/no-manual-schema-types` ESLint rule for shared schema files
