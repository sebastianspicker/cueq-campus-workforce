# Repo Cleanup Closeout — 2026-03-01

## Scope Completed

This closeout documents the cleanup/refactor pass covering docs/archive hygiene, frontend API-client deduplication, auth/integration deduplication, and MVP UX additions (`bookings`, `on-call`).

## Delivered Changes

### Documentation and Artifacts

- Moved root reconciliation artifacts to:
  - `docs/analysis/archive/2026-03-rc/prd-plan-gap-matrix.md`
  - `docs/analysis/archive/2026-03-rc/missing-items-ranked.md`
  - `docs/analysis/archive/2026-03-rc/status-reconciliation.md`
- Added analysis index: `docs/analysis/index.md`.
- Archived one-off references into `docs/references/archive/`.
- Reconciled stale status language:
  - `docs/product-specs/monthly-closing.md`
  - `docs/product-specs/closing-console.md`
- Rewrote `docs/FRONTEND.md` to current architecture.

### Frontend Refactor and UX

- Introduced shared web API layer:
  - `apps/web/src/lib/api-client.ts`
  - `apps/web/src/lib/api-context.tsx`
- Added foundational shared UI components:
  - `apps/web/src/components/PageShell.tsx`
  - `apps/web/src/components/SectionCard.tsx`
  - `apps/web/src/components/ConnectionPanel.tsx`
  - `apps/web/src/components/StatusBanner.tsx`
  - `apps/web/src/components/FormField.tsx`
- Added shared styles and layout updates:
  - `apps/web/src/app/globals.css`
  - `apps/web/src/app/layout.tsx`
  - `apps/web/src/app/[locale]/layout.tsx`
- Migrated locale pages to shared `useApiContext` usage and removed page-local API helper duplication.
- Added new UI routes:
  - `apps/web/src/app/[locale]/bookings/page.tsx`
  - `apps/web/src/app/[locale]/oncall/page.tsx`
- Expanded i18n/nav for `bookings` and `oncall`:
  - `apps/web/src/messages/en.json`
  - `apps/web/src/messages/de.json`

### API and Backend Dedup

- Added `GET /v1/oncall/deployments`:
  - `apps/api/src/phase2/controllers/oncall.controller.ts`
  - `apps/api/src/phase2/phase2.service.ts`
- Added query schema:
  - `packages/shared/src/schemas/oncall.ts`
- Added auth role mapping single source:
  - `apps/api/src/common/auth/role-mapping.ts`
  - consumed by mock/OIDC/SAML adapters.
- Added shared integration token validator:
  - `apps/api/src/common/integrations/integration-token.ts`
  - consumed by HR import and terminal gateway services.
- Added shared script arg parser:
  - `scripts/lib/parse-args.mjs`
  - consumed by backfill/import scripts.

### Tests and QoL

- Added web acceptance coverage for new routes/flows:
  - `apps/web/tests/acceptance/phase2.acceptance.spec.ts`
  - `apps/web/tests/acceptance/a11y.acceptance.spec.ts`
- Added API integration coverage for on-call deployment listing:
  - `apps/api/test/integration/phase3.integration.test.ts`
- Added `make` QoL commands:
  - `make quick`
  - `make docs-check`

## Remaining Deferred Work (Post-Cleanup Program)

- Deep logic migration out of `apps/api/src/phase2/phase2.service.ts` after the first extraction layer.
  - Completed in this pass: controller wiring through dedicated domain services under `apps/api/src/phase2/services/` for dashboard/bookings, workflows, and on-call.
  - Deferred: move full method bodies from `phase2.service.ts` into those domain services in follow-up slices.
- Broader conversion of inline page styles into component-level design tokens/classes.
- Additional incremental reductions for large page files (`roster`, `closing`, `reports`).

| `SEC-WEBHOOK-URL-001`           | `P1`     | Medium      | `apps/api/src/phase2/phase2.service.ts` webhook endpoint registration  | Webhook targets accepted generic URLs without explicit localhost/private-network restrictions. In production this can become an SSRF pivot via dispatcher calls. | Missing explicit target-host policy at registration time.                            | Added URL guard `apps/api/src/common/http/webhook-url.ts` (protocol + credential checks + private/localhost blocking in production by default), wired into `createWebhookEndpoint`, plus unit/integration coverage. |
| `DATA-BOOKING-INTERVAL-001`     | `P1`     | High        | `packages/shared/src/schemas/booking.ts` (`CreateBookingSchema`)       | Booking creation accepted inverted intervals (`endTime < startTime`), leading to invalid business state and downstream reporting distortions.                    | Missing interval ordering constraint in schema validation.                           | Added schema refinement (`endTime` must be strictly after `startTime`) and integration regression test.                                                                                                             |

| `REL-TEST-HOOK-TIMEOUT-001`     | `P2`     | High        | API integration/acceptance/compliance test hooks under full-suite load | 10s default hook timeout intermittently failed on DB reset/seed under high suite concurrency, cascading into false-negative suite failures.                      | Default Vitest hook timeout too low for environment load profile.                    | Increased API Vitest `hookTimeout`/`testTimeout` in integration/acceptance/compliance configs; increased heavy acceptance `beforeEach` timeout; full `make test-all` now green.                                     |

## Deep Code Inspection Findings (2026-03-01, Append)

Follow-up deep inspection focused on authorization drift, dispatch-time SSRF posture, and auth guard robustness.

| `AUTH-CLOSING-SCOPE-001`              | `P1`     | High        | `apps/api/src/phase2/phase2.service.ts` closing read/checklist endpoints | Closing permissions in spec allow `TEAM_LEAD` (own OU) and `HR/Admin`, but implementation reused a broader approval-role set that also included `SHIFT_PLANNER`. This widened data access for financial closing artifacts. | Cross-domain role-set reuse (`APPROVAL_ROLES`) for a domain with narrower authorization requirements. | Added dedicated `CLOSING_READ_ROLES` and switched `listClosingPeriods`, `getClosingPeriod`, and `closingChecklist` to that set; added integration regressions asserting `SHIFT_PLANNER` denial.            |
| `AUTH-CLOSING-REOPEN-001`             | `P1`     | Medium      | `apps/api/src/phase2/phase2.service.ts` `reopenClosing`                  | Reopen path relied on state-transition policy errors instead of explicit role gate, producing brittle access control and non-authoritative failure semantics.                                                              | Missing endpoint-level authorization guard for reopen action.                                         | Added explicit `HR/Admin` guard in `reopenClosing`; added integration regression asserting `TEAM_LEAD` reopen denial.                                                                                      |
| `DATA-EXPORT-OU-SCOPE-001`            | `P1`     | High        | `apps/api/src/phase2/phase2.service.ts` `exportClosing`                  | OU-scoped closing exports selected all time accounts in the period, allowing cross-organization data to leak into payroll artifacts.                                                                                       | Missing organization-unit predicate in export account query.                                          | Scoped export query by `closingPeriod.organizationUnitId` when present and added integration regression asserting non-target OU accounts are excluded.                                                     |
| `AUTH-CLOSING-ADMIN-PARITY-001`       | `P2`     | Medium      | `packages/core/src/core/closing/index.ts` transition engine              | Service-level role guards permitted Admin for reopen/correction, but transition engine still rejected non-HR actors, causing spec/behavior drift and unexpected 400 responses for Admin flows.                             | Authorization policy duplicated across layers with inconsistent role sets.                            | Updated core transition rules to allow `ADMIN` for `REOPEN` and `POST_CLOSE_CORRECTION`; added core and API integration regressions.                                                                       |
| `SEC-WEBHOOK-DISPATCH-REVALIDATE-001` | `P2`     | Medium      | `apps/api/src/phase2/phase2.service.ts` webhook dispatch loop            | Endpoint URL policy was validated on create, but not revalidated at dispatch. Existing records (or policy flips over time) could still trigger disallowed targets.                                                         | Validation only at write-time, no read-time safety check before network egress.                       | Added dispatch-time URL revalidation via `assertWebhookTargetUrl` before `fetch`; invalid targets now create failed delivery records and do not dispatch; added integration test for policy-flip scenario. |
| `REL-AUTH-HEADER-TYPE-001`            | `P3`     | Low         | `apps/api/src/common/guards/auth.guard.ts`                               | Guard assumed `authorization` header is always a string; duplicated header forms could surface `string[]` and cause avoidable runtime type errors.                                                                         | Overly narrow request-header typing in guard.                                                         | Hardened guard to handle both string and array header forms, then normalize to a single bearer token value before parsing.                                                                                 |

Added integration regression in `phase3.integration.test.ts`.                                                |

Unit tests added. |

Hostnames that resolve to private addresses (for example wildcard/rebinding domains) could bypass private-target blocking in production and cause internal-network dispatch attempts. | Validation was hostname-string based; no dispatch-time DNS-to-IP trust-boundary check. | Added dispatch-time DNS resolution enforcement in `assertWebhookDispatchTargetUrl` (`lookup(..., { all: true, verbatim: true })`) and rejection when any resolved address is private/local.

This creates an SSRF side channel through HTTP redirect chains even when initial endpoint validation is present.                              | Webhook dispatch did not constrain redirect handling at HTTP client level.             | Set webhook delivery fetch to `redirect: 'manual'` so redirects are not auto-followed, and combined it with dispatch-time target validation (`assertWebhookDispatchTargetUrl`) before every attempt. This closes both direct and redirected private-target bypass paths in the runtime dispatch loop.       |

| `SEC-WEBHOOK-PROD-HTTP-001`             | `P1`     | Medium      | `apps/api/src/common/http/webhook-url.ts`        | Production webhook registration accepted public `http://` targets when private-target override was not enabled, allowing cleartext delivery of event payloads across untrusted networks. | Protocol policy did not distinguish production transport requirements for public targets.  | Added production guard in `assertWebhookTargetUrl` to reject public `http://` targets unless private-target mode is explicitly enabled. Added unit regression `rejects public http targets in production when private-target override is not enabled` in `webhook-url.test.ts`. |
| `SEC-AUTH-BEARER-SIZE-001`              | `P2`     | Medium      | `apps/api/src/common/guards/auth.guard.ts`       | Authorization parsing accepted arbitrarily long bearer tokens and control characters, increasing parser/verification cost and malformed-header ambiguity at auth boundary.               | Missing token-shape hardening in guard prior to provider verification.                     | Added bearer token hardening in `AuthGuard`: max length cap (`4096`) and control-character rejection before `verifyToken`. Added unit regressions for oversized and malformed token cases in `auth.guard.test.ts`.                                                              |
| `REL-WEBHOOK-TRUNCATION-FLUSH-EDGE-001` | `P3`     | Low         | `apps/api/src/common/http/read-response-body.ts` | Bounded response reader could exceed the configured max when trailing decoder flush output was appended after loop completion, producing off-by-limit truncation behavior.               | Max-length enforcement was applied during stream loop, but not consistently on flush path. | Refactored bounded reader to enforce `maxChars` on both streamed chunks and decoder flush output; preserves truncation marker semantics. Added unit regression using truncated UTF-8 flush behavior in `read-response-body.test.ts`.                                            |
