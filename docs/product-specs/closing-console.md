# Product Spec: Closing Console

> Source, schema, and focused-test references are present; this is
> not audit certification, service-backed evidence, or deployment approval.

---

## 1. Summary

The Closing Console is cueq's structured end-of-month workflow. The repository
contains dedicated UI and API
surfaces; institutional audit acceptance remains external.

## 2. Closing Workflow

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Open: Month begins
    Open --> Review: Cut-off date reached
    Review --> Review: Fix issues
    Review --> Approved: All checklists green + lead/HR sign-off
    Approved --> Exported: Export run completed
    Exported --> [*]: Period archived

    Review --> Open: Re-open (HR only, audited)
    Exported --> Review: Post-close correction (HR workflow)
```

## 3. Checklist Items (auto-generated)

| Check                    | Severity | Description                                   |
| ------------------------ | -------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Missing bookings         | Error    | Days with no clock-in/out and no absence      |
| Booking gaps             | Warning  | Periods between bookings exceeding threshold  |
| Open correction requests | Error    | Unapproved workflow instances                 |
| Open leave requests      | Warning  | Pending approval; may affect balances         |
| Rule violations          | Error    | Rest period, max hours, or break violations   |
| Roster mismatches        | Warning  | Plan-vs-actual discrepancies not acknowledged |
| Balance anomalies        | Warning  | Balance exceeding configured cap              |

## 4. Approval Gates

1. Employee self-review (optional, configurable per OE): employee confirms their month
2. Team lead approval: certifies team data is complete
3. HR approval: final sign-off; triggers export eligibility
4. Post-close correction: available only to HR role; creates audited correction entries

## 5. Export Run Log

Each export produces an `ExportRun` record with:

- Timestamp, format (CSV/XML), record count, SHA-256 checksum
- Idempotent: re-running with unchanged data produces identical output
- Logged in audit trail with full metadata

## 6. UI Surface

The source contains a localized dedicated view at `/[locale]/closing` with:

- Month selector with status badges (Open / Review / Approved / Exported)
- Checklist panel with drill-down to individual items
- Approval buttons with confirmation dialogs
- Export trigger with progress indicator
- Post-close correction panel (HR role only)

The UI and API routes are repository source surfaces. Their operation in a
deployed environment requires service-backed and deployment evidence.
