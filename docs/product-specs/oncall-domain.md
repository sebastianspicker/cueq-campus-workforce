# Product Spec: On-Call Domain

> **CueQ Differentiator C** — On-call is a first-class domain, not just "time types".
> **Status:** ✅ MVP Implemented | **Schemas:** `@cueq/shared` `oncall.ts`

---

## 1. Summary

Most time-tracking systems model on-call as a generic "time type". CueQ treats it as a dedicated subdomain with:

- Rotation scheduling (weekly, daily, custom)
- Deployment/incident entries with optional ticket and event references
- Compliance checks (rest time after deployments)
- Reporting readiness (on-call hours, deployment count, average response time)

## 2. Data Model

### On-Call Rotation

An assignment of a person to an on-call period:

- `personId`, `organizationUnitId`
- `startTime`, `endTime` (typically week or day boundaries)
- `rotationType`: WEEKLY, DAILY, CUSTOM

### On-Call Deployment / Einsatz

An individual callout during a rotation:

- `rotationId`, `personId`
- `startTime`, `endTime`
- `remote`: boolean (at-site vs. remote resolution)
- `ticketReference`: optional link to IT ticketing system
- `eventReference`: optional link to event/incident
- `description`: free-text summary

### Compliance Check

Automated check for rest periods after deployments:

- After a night deployment, was the required 11h rest observed?
- If not, generate a policy violation
